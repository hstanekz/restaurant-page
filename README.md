## Introduction

This is a project for a restaurant page that allows users to navigate through different sections of the restaurant's website, such as the home page, menu, and about us page. The content is dynamically rendered using JavaScript modules bundled together with Webpack.

## What I Learned

During this project, I focused on learning how to use webpack to efficiently bundle modules together and improve the organization of my code. By dividing my code into separate modules, I was able to establish dependencies and enable a more efficient form of communication between different parts of the project.
